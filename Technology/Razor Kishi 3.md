# Razer Kishi v3

## Review

The Razer Kishi v3 feels good to hold. The analog buttons have grip. It is easily to connect; as soon as attach your phone to the USB-C connector, you can start using it. The controller extends to different sizes to fit most phones and springs back to hug it. Has rubber paddings to adjust for Apple and Android phones, but the paddings can also be removed to fit cases as well. It holds my Motorola 5G Edge with case well--as long as I remove my magsafe popsocket. The Kishi allows passthrough for both charging and audio. There are also configurable buttons on the back, mappable on the fly.

But what can you play? Without any configurations, you can play the games on your phone--as long as you have games that runs on landscape mode and have button support. Diablo Immortal is one. If you have Netflix, there are games there that works well: Braid, Dead Cells, Moonlighter. Epic Games also have mobile games that you can install and play. Then there is Razer Nexus. This allows for pairring with your desktop computer for game streaming. Game streaming depends on a good wireless internet connection and you sitting at a good distance from your router. With Nexus and Razer Cortex installed on the desktop computer, you can access games from Steam, Epic Games, and from the Microsoft Store.

Overall, I would recommend the Kishi for anyone that has games they want to play on their phone and a good wifi connection.

## Points

- Feels good to hold.
- Buttons have a nice dip that allows for good grip.
- Controller starts working as soon as you connect your phone to the USB-C connector.
- Easily extends and hold an array of different phone sizes. Holds my Motorola 5G Edge well.

- Passthrough also works for the audio jack to listen to whatever you're playing.
- Has configurable buttons on the back that you can assign on the fly.
- Razer also advertises the application Razor Nexus. That deserves it's own category of notes.

## Razor Nexus

Razor Nexus needs some set up. You'll have to go to the website and install Razor Cortex. Once downloaded and installed, you'll have to log into your Razor account.

Also, even time you turn on your computer, you'll have to open the app and go to "Remote Play" and pair again.

Awesome

- Allows for syncing with your desktop computer to play games via Streaming. It's like SteamLink, but works for other games outside of the Steam launcher as well.

Not so great

- While setting up, my games didn't load in the monitor I wanted them to load in. I had better luck disconnecting other monitors and enabling just the one.

Game streaming is great if you're environment is set up right. Mine isn't. Ideally, the desktop should be near the WiFi and your phone also needs to be near the WiFi.

## Mobile Games
