## Menu Order

Checks indicate that I would get the order again.

- [x] Pepperoni Pizza: The default choice that the kids will eat.
- [x] Pepperoni/Pineapple Pizza: The kind of pizza that Emily prefers.
- [x] Tomato/Pepperoni: I like having slices of tomato on my pizza.
- [ ] Meatball Sub: Didn't really care for the bread. And the meatball tasted like it was like a sausage. I prefer more of a tender meatball.
- [x] Garlic knots
