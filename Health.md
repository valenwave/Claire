# Health

- Sleep: I should get 7-9 hours of sleep. Therefore, I should go to sleep between 9:30 PM and 11:30 PM.

## Coffee

- Cups: It's okay to drink 4 cups of coffee in a day.
- I personally drink 1 cup of coffee in morning and then water the rest of the day.
- And I try to finish that cup of coffee before the afternoon.
