# SimpleNote

I love the search. I love the quick access to all devices. I use it to write up a draft and then migrate to my phone and copy and paste it if I'm writing a message to text to Facebook. Planning on migrating some stuff from SimpleNote to here, but keeping the temporary and unorganized stuff on SimpleNote.

## Flaw

Not being able to directly reference a note forces a search pattern and a philosophy for the app. But I do find myself using other apps when a direct link is prefered.
