# Razer Kishi v3

## Review

- Feels good to hold.
- Buttons have a nice dip that allows for good grip.
- Controller starts working as soon as you connect your phone to the USB-C connector.
- Easily extends and hold an array of different phone sizes. Holds my Motorola 5G Edge well.
- Has rubber paddings to adjust for Apple and Android phones. Paddings can be removed to fit phones with cases.
- Allows for passthrough charging to charge your device through the controller.
- Passthrough also works for the audio jack to listen to whatever you're playing.
- Has configurable buttons on the back that you can assign on the fly.
- Razer also advertises the application Razor Nexus. That deserves it's own category of notes.

## Razor Nexus

Razor Nexus needs some set up. You'll have to go to the website and install Razor Cortex. Once downloaded and installed, you'll have to log into your Razor account. 

Also, even time you turn on your computer, you'll have to open the app and go to "Remote Play" and pair again.

Awesome

- Allows for syncing with your desktop computer to play games via Streaming. It's like SteamLink, but works for other games outside of the Steam launcher as well.

Not so great

- While setting up, my games didn't load in the monitor I wanted them to load in. I had better luck disconnecting other monitors and enabling just the one.

Game streaming is great if you're environment is set up right. Mine isn't. Ideally, the desktop should be near the WiFi and your phone also needs to be near the WiFi.
