Razer Cortex was not released under its current name but evolved from a previous software called **Razer Game Booster**. The lineage of the software dates back to **2012**.

The initial version, **Razer Game Booster**, was released to the public in beta on **November 22, 2012**. This software was itself an evolution of IObit's Game Booster and was designed to optimize system settings to improve gaming performance.

The rebranding to **Razer Cortex** appears to have occurred around **2014**. User discussions on forums like Steam from October 2014 indicate that the software previously known as Razer Game Booster was by then called Razer Cortex.

Since then, Razer Cortex has seen numerous major updates, including the release of Cortex 9.0 on July 17, 2018, and a significant overhaul with Cortex 10 in June 2022, solidifying its place as a multifaceted game launcher and system optimization tool for PCs.
